# Lists Practice  

This folder contains Python exercises that demonstrate how to work with lists in Python.  

## Exercise: Dinner Guests  

**File:** `dinner_guests.py`  

### Concepts Covered
- Creating a list of guests  
- Accessing list elements using indexes  
- Modifying the list with:
  - `append()` – add items to the end  
  - `insert()` – insert items at specific positions  
  - `remove()` – remove items by value  
  - `pop()` – remove items by index (last in this case)  
- Deleting list elements with `del`  
- Printing personalized messages using f-strings  

### Program Flow
1. Start with 3 guests and print invitations.  
2. Replace one unavailable guest with a new one.  
3. Add more guests (at the beginning, middle, and end).  
4. Shrink the guest list to only 2 people using `pop()`.  
5. Delete the last two guests from the list.  

This exercise helps practice **list manipulation** and **string formatting** in Python.
