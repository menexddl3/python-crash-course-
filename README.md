# 🐍 Python Crash Course – My Learning Journey

This repository documents my learning and progress through the book **"Python Crash Course (3rd Edition)"** by Eric Matthes. I started this journey with the goal of becoming a strong software developer, and I’m tracking everything I study, practice, and struggle with along the way.

I practiced everything on my laptop, but unfortunately, it broke down recently. Still, I’m committed to continuing my learning journey using whatever tools I can access next — possibly mobile IDEs or online compilers.

## 💬 Reflections & Challenges

- I faced some confusion at first with list operations and string formatting.
- Remembering syntax for each function took effort.
- Sometimes I hit dead-ends, but pushing through taught me how to troubleshoot better.
- I’ve realized learning coding is just as much about *mindset* as it is about syntax.

## 🚀 Next Steps

- Continue with loops and conditionals
- Learn about dictionaries and functions
- Build a simple mini-project (like a quiz app or calculator)
- Explore mobile IDEs or cloud tools to keep learning without a laptop
